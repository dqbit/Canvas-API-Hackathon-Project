# Canvas-API-Hackathon-Project
Implementation of a feature that allows a canvas user to find the people with most shared courses. Aimed at helping with making new friends in classes. **Our group had two different implementations. This implementation is written by me in Jupyter notebook, with starting instructions provided to us.**
